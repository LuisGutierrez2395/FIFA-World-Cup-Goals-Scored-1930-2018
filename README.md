This project reflects my journey to becoming a better data analyst and my passion for football, especially inspired by Peru's participation in the 2018 World Cup.

## Project Motivation
As an aspiring data analyst and a football enthusiast, I embarked on this project to hone my skills in data sourcing, cleaning, and visualization. This project aims to provide insights and trends that can captivate any football fan or data enthusiast.

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Collection
The journey began with extensive research to find appropriate datasets related to World Cup goals. The data was gathered from various  sources on the internet, ensuring a comprehensive historical record.

### 2. Data Preparation
The collected data was exported into CSV files and imported into a relational database. Using SQL, I meticulously cleaned and prepared the data to ensure its readiness for analysis. This step involved:

- Cleaning and normalizing data
- Removing duplicates
- Ensuring consistency in data formats
  
### 3. Data Analysis in Tableau
With the data prepared, I leveraged Tableau's powerful visualization tools to analyze and display the results. The interactive dashboard presents various dimensions of World Cup goals, including:

Top goals scored by team
Goals scored by tournament
Goals scored by stage
Goals scored by match hour

## Repository Contents
- Data: The raw and cleaned datasets used for the analysis.
- SQL Scripts: The SQL queries and scripts employed for data preparation.

## Conclusion
This project is more than just an analysis; it is a testament to my joy for data analytics and football. Through this endeavor, I have gained valuable experience in data handling and visualization, which I am excited to share with you. I hope this dashboard provides an engaging way to explore the fascinating world of FIFA World Cup goals.
